\textbf{(\,H\,A\,R\,M\,O\,N\,Y\,)} was composed for Echoi Ensemble on a text
written for the project by Paul Griffiths. The world premiere was given by
Echoi Ensemble under the direction of Jonathan Hepfer on 13 January 2020 in
Zipper Concert Hall during the 2019/20 season of the Monday Evening Concerts in
Los Angeles, California. The work is dedicated, with warmth and appreciation,
to Jonathan Hepfer for more than a decade of exacting artistic collaboration
and profoundly meaningful friendship.
