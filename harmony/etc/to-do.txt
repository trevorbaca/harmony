TO-DO
=====

1.  Include preface note that XFB here is also always tasto.

2.  Fix [B, m2, percussion 1] staff position workaround.
    Arises because clef change happens at start of on-beat grace container.

3.  Add semantic purpleheart staff position function.
    harmony.purpleheart_positions([-1, 0, 1, 1]), etc.

4.  Remove accidentals from tied-into notes.

5.  Add double flageolet symbol.
    Extend baca.flageolet() with count=1 keyword.

6.  Make whisk spanner.

7.  Hide dots when stems are hidden in glissandi.

8.  Renotate 5-quarter durations as 4:5 monads throughout.

9.  Rewrite nonpitched percussion on single staff.
    Alterate between only 5-line glockenspiel staff and custom nonpitched
    staff. Attach glockenspiel and unpitched percussion instruments at the
    right places. Redo glockenspiel pitches as sounding (rather than written).

10. Add invisible-rewrite rhythms.

11. Debug simultaneous clef / after-grace error.

12. Debug simultaneous text spanner / pitched trill spanner error.

13. Notate covered flute pitches as solid / rhombus chords at m7.
